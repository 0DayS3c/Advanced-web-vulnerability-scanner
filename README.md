# Advanced Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The **Advanced Web Vulnerability Scanner** is a client-side JavaScript tool designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in web applications. It performs both basic and advanced scans for common vulnerabilities, including open redirects, CSRF protection issues, insecure cookies, and exposure of sensitive information.

## Features

- **Basic Scans:**
  - Detects open redirect vulnerabilities in URLs.
  - Identifies forms lacking visible CSRF protection tokens.
  - Provides a conceptual warning about limitations in checking cookie security.
  - Finds sensitive information in JavaScript files and inline scripts.

- **Advanced Scans:**
  - Thoroughly checks for open redirects in various elements.
  - Enhances CSRF protection checks, including dynamic JavaScript tokens.
  - Issues a conceptual warning about cookie security limitations.
  - Utilizes advanced pattern matching for detecting sensitive information in meta tags and data attributes.

## Installation

To integrate the scanner into your web application:

1. **Download or Copy the Script:**
   - Download the `scanner.js` file from the repository or copy the script content from this repository.

2. **Include in Your HTML:**
   - Add the script to your HTML file, preferably before the closing `</body>` tag:

     ```html
     <script src="path/to/scanner.js"></script>
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can embed the script directly:

     ```html
     <script>
     // Paste the script content here
     </script>
     ```

## Usage

1. **Load the Page:**
   - The script will automatically run when the page loads.

2. **View Results:**
   - Open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click -> Inspect -> Console) to see the results.

3. **Review Findings:**
   - The script outputs potential vulnerabilities to the console. Review and address these findings as needed.
